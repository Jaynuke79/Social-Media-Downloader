### 1) Organizing Downloads [Implemented ([f73218c5](https://github.com/Jaynuke79/Social-Media-Downloader/commit/f73218c5204ad59965c0903623d09f7efcf4bf1c))] [Refined and Fixed ([5c0f9e4](https://github.com/Jaynuke79/Social-Media-Downloader/commit/5c0f9e4e926df06adc0a26cfff0efa1e455e1197))]


Have a subdirectory system within the default download location that organizes the downloads. 

An example being organizing by platform: If downloading from instagram, download the files in `<Default Download Location> -> Instagram -> <Author> -> <Download Files>` 

### 2) Downloading Additional Media Info

Along with downloading the media, download comments, descriptions, and other additional info from the media in question. 

An example being downloading the comments of a tiktok video and saving them as a csv with the video of the video itself.
